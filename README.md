# personalwebsite
I have created this website to showcase my work.

I'm learning Java through the Java Masterclass on Udemy. There are many exercises and challenges to complete, and I decided to try using that code by building an REST API server using Spring Boot.

I deployed the API with render.com  using Docker image.
My website is deployed with netlify.com
